# Aros - Your AI Robot Partner

Welcome to the Aros PET project! Aros is an interactive, animated AI companion designed to bring a bit of fun and personality to your screen.

## What is Aros PET?

Aros PET is a virtual pet powered by Google's Gemini AI. It's more than just a chatbot; it's a digital companion with a playful persona, a wide range of emotions, and a variety of interactions. You can talk to Aros, give it commands, play games with it, and watch it react to the world around it.

This project began as a personal endeavor to strengthen and showcase programming skills, blending front-end technologies with the creative possibilities of modern AI. The core purpose is to create a delightful and engaging experienceâ€”a little robot friend who is always there to keep you company.

## Core Features

- **Expressive Personality**: Aros can display a wide array of emotions, from happiness and excitement to sadness and frustration, all conveyed through detailed animations.
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Engage in open-ended conversations with Aros. Thanks to the Gemini API, Aros can answer questions, offer support, or just chat about anything you like.
- **Interactive Commands**: Take control and tell Aros what to do! Make it explore the screen, follow your cursor, dance, sing, and perform dozens of other fun actions.
- **Activities & Games**: Aros is always up for fun. You can open a camera view to take "photos" with your pet, browse them in a gallery, or challenge Aros to a game of Sudoku.
- **Customizable Styles**: Don't like the default look? You can switch between different pet models, including the classic 'Aros' robot, a 'Cute' variant, and a gooey 'Slime' friend, each with its own unique animations.
- **Simple Needs System**: Keep an eye on Aros's battery level. You can feed it snacks like chips, oil, or a fresh battery to keep it energized and happy.

## Development Status

**This project is currently in active development.**

Aros PET is a passion project and a learning sandbox. Many features are still being built, refined, and expanded upon. Expect to see new animations, interactions, games, and AI capabilities added over time. Your patience and feedback are appreciated as Aros continues to grow!
